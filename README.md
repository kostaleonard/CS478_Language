# README #

(The language formerly known as mousecop) is the best thing since sliced bread. It was my CS478: Programming Languages project. It isn't as clean as I would like, but there are some cool ideas here.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Writing dank programs
* Version 1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* git clone
* Hope the dependencies are not out of whack

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Sorry, I fly solo

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Probably no one since I don't plan to do any maintenance anyway
* But you can contact me at kostaleonard@gmail.com if you really feel like it
